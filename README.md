# Final Project Milestone 1: Data Exploration & Prototyping

**Due Date for Both Milestones:** November 10th, 11:55 PM

## Objective

These milestones are designed to help you start building the foundation of your final project by exploring your dataset and structuring your project’s visual layout. Completing these steps will enable you to refine your project scope, identify any potential issues, and set a clear plan for development.

## Instructions

### Milestone 1: Exploring Data and Making Basic Visualizations

In this milestone, you will conduct exploratory data analysis to assess your dataset, validate your project scope, and identify any challenges.

#### 1. Create Preliminary Visualizations

- Develop basic visualizations to help you better understand your data and answer initial questions.
- Use these visualizations to uncover patterns, trends, or gaps in the data.

#### 2. Identify Challenges and Limitations

- **Data Challenges**: Reflect on any difficulties with your dataset, such as missing values, unexpected formats, or inconsistencies.
- **Scope Limitations**: Identify any limitations that could impact your project scope or require adjustments.

#### 3. Update Scope and Visualization Needs

- Based on your exploration, make any necessary adjustments to your project scope.
- List the types of visualizations you will need to create in your final project.

**Deadline**: November 10th

### Milestone 2: Prototyping and Structuring Your Visualizations

This milestone focuses on planning the structure and layout of your visualizations on your project website.

#### 1. Create a Website Layout in Figma

- Design a website layout using **Figma** (or any preferred design tool) that shows where each visualization will be placed.
- Explain why each visualization is positioned in its respective location, considering factors such as readability, user flow, and interaction.

#### 2. Plan Tools and Roles

- Identify any specific tools or libraries (e.g., D3.js, Vega-Lite) needed to create the visualizations or interactive elements.
- If working in a group, assign roles and responsibilities to ensure smooth collaboration.

#### 3. Anticipate Potential Difficulties

- Note any areas where you may need additional support, such as programming assistance or help with certain visualizations.

**Deadline**: November 10th

### 3. Submission Instructions

- Submit a **single PDF file** containing:
  - **Milestone 1**: Screenshots of preliminary visualizations, an analysis of challenges and limitations, and an updated list of visualization needs.
  - **Milestone 2**: A Figma (or design tool) layout for your website, an explanation for each visualization’s placement, and a breakdown of tools and roles (if applicable).

- Ensure your file is named as follows:

## Some Tips:

- **Start with Simple Visualizations**: Don’t worry about perfecting every detail initially; focus on understanding the data.
- **Use Figma for Prototyping**: If you are new to Figma, check out tutorials on layout design to help you create a visually organized prototype.
- **Seek Feedback**: Discuss any challenges or ideas with classmates or us to get fresh perspectives and solutions.
